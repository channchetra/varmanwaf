//! `login_history` ΓÇö one row per successful control-plane login.
//!
//! Written by the login handlers (password and passkey) with the resolved
//! client IP and, best effort, its geolocation. The anomaly detector
//! (`crate::notify::login_anomaly`) compares a login's country against the
//! most recent resolved entries of the same account; the dashboard reads
//! the rows back for the login audit view.
